# Spring-Boot-Web-App-4-23-5pm

This is my final project for the Promineo Tech backend development bootcamp.

I created a web application with various database relationships, including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. 

I utilized JPA for Java app DB mapping, Swagger for API design and documentation, and MySQL Workbench for DB modeling. 

Development was done using Spring Boot in Eclipse IDE for efficient API development, with the application running on port 8080. 

Clone and run from http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/ to explore the APIs.
